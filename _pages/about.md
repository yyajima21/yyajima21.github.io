I am a second-year PhD student majoring in [Robotics](http://robotics.gatech.edu/education/phd) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) advised by Prof.[Yong K. Cho](http://rical.ce.gatech.edu/). Before joining the Robotics PhD program, I received M.S. in Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Tech, specializing in robotics, automation, and controls in 2020. My research interests lie at the intersection of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Controls for mobile robots. Over the past few years, I've been working on computer vision, deep learning, and mobile robot projects at [SDM Research Lab](https://ecdm.gatech.edu/) and [RICAL Research Lab](http://rical.ce.gatech.edu/).

My project page is hosted [here](/project.html).
