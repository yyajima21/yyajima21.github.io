Over the past few years, I've worked on several personal & team projects related to computer vision, machine learning, and robotics. I am currently a software member at RoboJackets working for perception and scene understanding projects using deep learning approach. Beside RoboJackets, I also built an autonomous snowplow robot. In this project pages, I include some of projects related to machine learning and robotics.

[RoboJackets](https://robojackets.org/) is a competitive robotics team at Georgia Tech. Within this organization, I am a part of the [RoboNav Team](https://robojackets.org/teams/robonav/) working for computer vision projects such as object detection, classification, and point cloud processing using deep learning approach.

<br /><br />
This project is a part of ME6408 Advanced Mechatronics Group Project. The goal is to develop a low cost autonomous snowplow robot that can remove snow from a designated area. I was in charge of software development especially computer vision and navigation tasks.
