Over the last two years, I have been working on computer a vision and robotics project at [SDM Research Lab](https://ecdm.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech. I completed my master of science degree in Mechanical Engineering with a focus on robotics, automation, and controls. In Fall 2020, I started my Ph.D. program in Robotics at [RICAL Research Lab](http://rical.ce.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech.
